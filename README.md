# Hello, I'm Cristofer Martinez <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

##### I'm a full-stack web developer who's got a passion for learning, developing, and enjoying the great outdoors.

### About Me
**Developer Passions:**
Through my studies toward becoming a web developer, I found I had a knack for web design and UI construction. And while the front-end is enjoyable, my real passion lies in developing the back-end of my projects. Creating all the API calls and verifying everything is working as intended is just the best feeling.

**Advancing My Skills:**
To strengthen my skills and continue accumulating knowledge in web development, I spend a fair amount of time each week going through online courses and reading about upcoming technologies.

**Outside of Web Development:**
When I'm not coding, I'm with friends or family, playing sports, and learning new skills.
